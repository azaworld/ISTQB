# ISTQB

##  Why testing is so important in software development?
    >...to find errors, gaps, or missing requirements in comparison to the actual requirements. 
    >...Determining the performance of the software
    >...Satisfaction of the customer
    >...Security etc..
    
## Defect, Error, Bug, Failure and Fault!
> The **defect** is an error found AFTER the application goes into production.

>An **error** is a mistake, misconception, or misunderstanding on the part of a software developer.

>A **bug** is the result of a coding error. 

>Error can be any mistake or can be an expected error when you are not giving correct input. But bug is when output deviates from expected result

> **Fault**:An incorrect step, process or data definition in a computer program that causes the program to perform in an unintended or unanticipated manner.

**Exhaustive testing is a test approach in which all possible data combinations are used for testing.**


## Causes of software defects ##
 
- Miscommunication of requirements introduces error in code
- Unrealistic time schedule for development
- Lack of designing experience
- Lack of coding practices experience
- Human factors introduces errors in code
- Lack of version control
- Buggy third-party tools
- Last minute changes in the requirement introduce error
- Poor Software testing skill
